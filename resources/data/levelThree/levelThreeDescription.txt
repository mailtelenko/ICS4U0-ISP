Welcome to the final level of Cyber Case! For your final task, you must use your detective skills to determine who is the suspicious individual messaging strangers online. You have 5 minutes to ask the users questions by clicking on the given button prompts. In order to complete this level, you must close the chat window of the suspicious user. You may close the chat window at any time, and you may choose not to ask every question, as time affects your score. However, an incorrect close will cause you to restart the level. At the end of the level you will be presented with a quiz which is based on what you learned during the level. A 75% or greater is required to pass the quiz, and any incorrect answers will negatively affect your final score. Good luck and have fun learning!
